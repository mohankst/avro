Please run these commands from the terminal. Never forget to be in relevant directory.\r\n\r\n\t```\r\n\twget \"https://github.com/ugcoder/avro/releases/download/v2.0/avro_2.0-1_all.deb\"\r\n\t```\r\n\t```\r\n\tsudo dpkg -i avro_2.0-1_all.deb\r\n\t```\r\n\tIf you get any dependency error, then also run the following command:\r\n\t```\r\n\tsudo apt-get install -fy\r\n\t```\r\n\tI hope, all is well now and the installation has been finished.\r\n\r\n 2. Go to `System Settings -> Language Support` from _Unity Launcher_\r\n 3. Look at the `Keyboard input method system`  \r\n 4. Select __IBus__ and close the window.\r\n 5. I believe that you need to restart __IBus__ to make everything work fine. Try the following command:\r\n\t```\r\n\tibus restart\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n 6. Now go to `System Settings -> Keyboard -> Text Entry`.\r\n 7. Search and add __Avro Phonetic__ as input source. That's all.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n \r\n__IBus Engine__ by __Sarim Khan__ <sarim2005@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n[__Avro JavaScript Phonetic Library__](https://github.com/torifat/jsAvroPhonetic) by [__Rifat Nabi__](https://github.com/torifat)\r\n\r\n__Avro Phonetic Dictionary Search Library__ by [__Mehdi Hasan Khan__](https://github.com/omicronlab)\r\n\r\n__Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (multi-arch) Binary Package__ by [__Maksudur Rahman Maateen__](https://github.com/ugcoder)\r\n\r\n_Licensed under Mozilla Public License 1.1 (\"MPL\"), an open source/free software license._\r\n",
